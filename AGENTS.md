# Process

Check todo.md to see if it contains anything relevant to what you have been asked to do. If not, then please update the todo file.

Update the todo file when you are finished with a task.

# Documentation 

Maintain the README when code is changed that affects anything described there.

Update docs/architecture.md any time the architecture or design is changed substantially. This includes changes, additions and deletions.

Update docs/todo.md any time you complete a task or spot a new task that needs to be completed.

# Code

Run tests before committing changes.

When undertaking a task, consider what changes will be needed in the test suite and incorporate this into your plan.

Ensure that you update existing tests or create new tests to cover new or changed code.

Remove redundant code when refactoring but take extra care to ensure that this will not break anything.

Review project dependencies on every run. Update out of date Python requirements files and NPM package files or any other dependency management manifests.
